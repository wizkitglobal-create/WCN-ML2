## Welcome to ML2 - The World's First Completely Open-Source Dataset for Litter

We're excited to present Machine Learning for Mitigating Litter (ML2), a groundbreaking initiative dedicated to the advancement of environmental conservation through technology. ML2 is proud to be the world's first completely open-source dataset specifically curated for litter analysis and management.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to leverage the power of machine learning and community-driven efforts to tackle the global challenge of litter and plastic waste. By providing an open-source dataset, we aim to encourage innovation and research in this vital area.

### Key Resources and Collaborations

- **Powered by Technology**: ML2 thrives on the robust infrastructure and tools provided by **Render**, **Roboflow**, and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. These platforms offer the backbone for our data processing, machine learning model training, and hosting services.

- **Sponsorship**: We are incredibly grateful for the generous sponsorship from **IDEA_UKM**. Their support plays a crucial role in driving our project forward and making a tangible impact in the field of environmental tech.

- **Software Development**: The seamless experience of our app and website is the result of the exceptional software full-stack development work by **Mushfiqur Rahman Saad**. 

- **Partnerships**: Collaboration is key to our success. We are honored to partner with **International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)** and **Impactlution**. These organizations bring invaluable knowledge, resources, and support to our initiative.

### Why ML2?

- **Open-Source Dataset**: Our dataset is freely available to researchers, developers, and environmentalists. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration to drive innovation.

- **Global Impact**: By focusing on litter, ML2 addresses a universal environmental issue. Our dataset has the potential to fuel solutions with a worldwide impact.

- **Community Driven**: ML2 is more than just a dataset; it's a community. We encourage contributions, feedback, and collaborative projects to continually enhance the dataset.
